# Terraform onpremise
Terraform resource templates are written for varied services for on-premise usage, to be scaled on Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.

Eventhough traditionally they are installed on multiple host machines with Ansible, but here we want to use containers to fulfill the reliability and scalability of one service via containers.
