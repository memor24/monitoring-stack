# Terraform onpremise
Terraform resource templates are written for varied services for on-premise usage, to be scaled on Kubernetes.

Eventhough traditionally they are installed on multiple host machines with Ansible, but here we want to use containers to address the requirement of the reliability and scalability of each service via containers.
